They've been searching all year but just haven't found the perfect one. Today, we want to offer up a few solutions to help those of you who aren't having much luck with your search.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><ul><li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>New construction may be the answer.</b> We work with several builders who can build the home you're looking for. There is a new development called Coyote Rock, which is on the Spokane River. Price points range from $170,000 to $1 million, so there are many great options out there.</span></li><li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>There are more sellers than it seems. </b>We're in contact with many homeowners who, for one reason or another, are waiting until spring to sell their home. We have their contact information, and can put you in touch with them before their home goes on the market. It's a win-win for both sides if you can find a great home and they can sell theirs without having to deal with the unpredictability of the market. We're also willing to go door to door for our clients, to find buyers for their current home and sellers of their future home.</span></li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Inventory is currently pretty low here in Spokane, which gives sellers an advantage - the fewer the homes, the greater the demand. On the other hand, we're still experiencing incredibly low interest rates; if buyers can find the right home, they can lock in an affordable rate.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We're always here to pair buyers and sellers in such a way that both sides benefit greatly from the transaction. If you or anyone you know wants a smooth real estate experience, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We'd be pleased to assist you!</span></div></div>
