Requesting mortgage forbearance might not be the answer you’re looking for.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of requesting forbearance for your home mortgage, there are a few things you should know beforehand.&nbsp;

First, let’s clarify what forbearance actually means. **Forbearance is a type of relief mortgage companies are offering to economically distressed homeowners who can’t make their monthly mortgage payments at this time.** It gives them a six-month grace period where they don’t have to make any mortgage payments at all.&nbsp;

The challenge, though, is that these companies require you to pay back the accumulated sum once the forbearance period is over. So if your normal mortgage payment is $2,000 per month and you enter a six-month forbearance, you’ll have to pay $12,000 once it’s over. Either they’ll demand that payment in full immediately or divide it up and tack it onto your resumed payment schedule.&nbsp;

For many people, getting caught up after the forbearance is over is difficult. Those who can’t do it may suggest a refinancing, but to refinance you have to have made at least three months’ worth of continuous mortgage&nbsp; payments.

If either of these options don’t work, what can you do? **You can always sell your home, which is something a lot of my clients have done.** If you sell, you can at least reap the rewards of a great seller’s market. Most homes have appreciated 5% to 10% over the past several years, so you can take advantage of that tremendous equity growth. If you wait to sell, you may not be able to buy again.&nbsp;

Oftentimes, homeowners want to hold onto their home as long as they can. I understand this feeling, but that can have a detrimental effect on your credit. If you sell now, you will be able to buy again down the road. As I said, a lot of my clients are doing this and turning their economic hardship into a positive thing.&nbsp;
