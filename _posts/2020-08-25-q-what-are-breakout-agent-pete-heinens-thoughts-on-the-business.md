<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our talented agent Pete Heinen is on a ‘heater.’ Here’s his story.</em></p>

Today we’re chatting with Pete Heinen, one of our rising stars here at the Legacy Group, about the success he’s achieved in just two years and why he got into real estate in the first place. A Spokane native and former athlete, Pete’s familiarity with the area and competitive drive made him a perfect fit for our philosophy of being second to none. To hear how he’s also leveraged his customer service experience at a high-end hotel to thrive in real estate and why he chose our team in particular, watch our latest video above.&nbsp;

0:43 — A brief overview of Pete’s background in sports and hospitality

2:48 — Pete’s approach to working with buyers from vastly different backgrounds

3:37 — Why real estate, and why the Legacy Group?&nbsp;

4:50 — The importance of operating with integrity and honor in the real estate world&nbsp;

5:40 — What surprised Pete the most upon entering this business?&nbsp;

As Pete touched on, real estate isn’t about landing a few big deals so you can go golfing the rest of the week; **it’s a daily grind that’s far from easy,** and those who don’t have Pete’s drive and work ethic get filtered out rather quickly. That being said, if you put in the necessary time and effort, prioritize clients’ needs, and carry yourself with a professional pride, you see results that make it all worthwhile. A shoutout to Pete for working his tail off thus far, and here’s to many more deals in his future\!&nbsp;

If you have any real estate-related questions or needs, please feel free to reach out to us here at the Legacy Group via phone or email. We’re here to be a resource for you, and we look forward to hearing from you soon\!&nbsp;
