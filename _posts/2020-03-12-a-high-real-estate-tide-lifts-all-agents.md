<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here at the Legacy Group, we believe that if you want to achieve success, you must surround yourself with successful people.</em></p>

Have you ever heard of the saying, “A high tide lifts all boats”?

This another way of saying **you’re a product of the five closest people you surround yourself with.** If you want to achieve your goals for 2020, you need to surround yourself with successful people.&nbsp;

Here at the Legacy Group, we have the top producers in the industry who are willing to share their successes, failures, challenges, and habits they’ve developed over the years with other agents, and this impacts their life tremendously. In fact, we have over 200 years’ worth of experience on our team.&nbsp;

**If you want to be successful, you must surround yourself with successful people.** Our agents have had the most success out of any other team in the area over the past decade, and that’s a huge attribute to new agents who join us. By surrounding yourself with high-level, high-minded, top-producing people, you’ll redefine your potential.&nbsp;

Keep in mind, this concept works both ways. If you surround yourself with unmotivated individuals who *aren’t* looking for that next level of achievement in their lives, it’s reasonable to assume that this will impact you in a negative way.&nbsp;

It’s like I tell my agents: We always focus on who our children spend time with. We want them to hang out with the smartest, best, and most polite families, and the same logic applies to us as adults.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know how we can help you achieve the next level of success in your life, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
