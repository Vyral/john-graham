The new year is here and before you know it, the spring selling season will be here. Today we are going to talk about how we prepare our sellers to put their homes on the market in the spring.


The first thing we want to talk about is having your mindset ready to sell your home. A lot of sellers are emotionally involved in their home, so selling is a big decision. What you really need to focus on is that the home is not a family member, but a building and a business investment. You have to do whatever it takes to cash in on that investment, and being too emotional can hurt that.

Next, you want to hire the right agent. The best way to find the right agent is by looking at
their track record of success. In Couer d'Alene and Spokane, nobody has a better track record than The Legacy Group. We have sold more homes in the last 5 years than anybody else in the inland northwest and sold over 350 just this last year. We have the systems in place that allow us to do things other agents can't, and sell your home much faster.

Finally, pricing your home correctly is a big step. There is a school of thought out there that pricing your home high initially will eventually bring you the most money for your home sale. In reality, that's not the truth. We have found, through our track record of success, if you price a home correctly at first, it allows us to negotiate more aggressively on your behalf to get you that full price offer you want.

We'd like to thank everyone for checking out our blog today. We truly appreciate your business and staying in touch with us. If you have any questions for us at all, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us a quick email today.
