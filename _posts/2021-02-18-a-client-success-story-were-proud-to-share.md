<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s an example of what it’s like to grow your wealth in real estate.</em></p>

Michael Kiter is one of the senior agents at the Legacy Group, and today he joins me to tell the story of how he was able to help a family buy, sell, and grow their net worth over 10 years.&nbsp;

How did this relationship start? 10 years ago, they saw his number on a sign and called him up. They were buyers at that time, back when the real estate market was quite a bit different. The first house he helped them buy was one of our own listings, and they purchased it for $79,000.&nbsp;

Six years later, he sold that house for them and helped them buy another one of our listings for about $150,000. This year, because our market is amazing right now, they’ve asked Michael to help them sell that home and buy another for $300,000.&nbsp;

I love this story. We shot a video not too long ago about growing your net worth through real estate, and that’s exactly what Michael helped this family do. Oftentimes, starting your net worth in real estate boils down to when you buy and sell your first home. This family started at $79,000, and they now hold almost 4x as much real estate as they did a decade ago.&nbsp;

Their household has grown in the meantime. The first house was a 2-bedroom/1-bathroom property because the parents didn’t have any kids. **They now have two kids, Nathan and Lydia, so they’ve been needing more space**, and the home they’re moving into is perfect.

Michael was happy to lend a hand, and his favorite part of helping these people buy and sell many times is the fact that they’re, in his words, “total advocates.” They love doing business with us because we made it easy each time.

“On top of that,” Michael says, “you should see Lydia’s face every time we walk into this new home. Her eyes absolutely light up. It is amazing to watch them walk through the home, and the kids are running through and selecting their rooms. It’s just… heartwarming.”

That’s why we do what we do. **It’s awesome to hear that those kids have that happiness in their lives because of something we did.** Kudos to Michael\!
