<p style="text-align:center;"><em>It’s an incredible time to sell right now, and today we’ll explain why.</em></p>

There are a couple of developments taking place in our market right now that make it prime for sellers looking to list by the end of the year, and today we’ll be sharing them with you.

**First of all, home prices have gone up and are the highest they’ve ever been in our area.** Year over year, they’ve risen roughly 11%. For a home that was worth $300,000 last year, this constitutes a $33,000 rise in value.&nbsp;

**The second reason that now is such a good time to sell is that interest rates are at historic lows.** Buyers can currently lock in a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at super-low rates, meaning they have greater buying power to apply toward an offer on your home.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of selling, have any other questions, would like more information, or are simply curious about what your home might be worth today, please reach out to our team. We’d be happy to discuss your home selling goals and we look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
