You have two great options in our current real estate market.

Many things are up in the air right now; what are the best options in our current real estate market?&nbsp;

**1\. Selling.** Is it a good time to sell your home? Absolutely\! In fact, just before recording this video, I heard from Steven, one of our top agents, that he received multiple offers on one of his listings, and sold the house for $60,000 over asking price, all within 48 hours. Those sellers are elated right now\!

**2\. Refinancing.** I am personally refinancing a couple of my investment properties at the moment. I’ll be dropping from a 3.78% interest rate to around 3%. That’s enormous savings in the long run. You could get these great rates too\!&nbsp;

We would love to help you with either of these options or anything else you need to do concerning real estate. Please give us a call or send an email if you have any questions. We look forward to speaking with you.
