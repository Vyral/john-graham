*We hope you and your family have a happy, fun, and safe Halloween this year.*

Happy Halloween to all of you from the Legacy Group. One of our family’s favorite traditions is going to the pumpkin patch and letting the kids pick out their pumpkins. We know it’s a little bit different from holidays past, but we know you all are going to have a great time, however you celebrate. To see our full Halloween message, watch this short video.
