Why Hire the Legacy Group to Buy or Sell Your Home

When making one of the largest financial decisions of your life, doesn't it make sense to hire a team with a proven track record of success?

Our team has a perfect record. In fact, we've been the #1 team in the Inland Northwest for the past six years in a row! We sold 327 homes last year, and over 1,500 in the past six years.

We're so confident in our abilities that we have a Guaranteed Sale program. Meaning if we don't sell your home, we'll buy it from you.

For our buyers, we have our Love It or Leave It Guarantee. If you're unhappy with your new home in the first 6 months after moving in, we'll sell it for you for free.

If you're looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate in Spokane, Coeur d'Alene, or Northern Idaho, please don't hesitate to contact us and our team of real estate professionals.
