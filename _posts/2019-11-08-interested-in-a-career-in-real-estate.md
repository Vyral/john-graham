<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Today we’ll discuss what a career in real estate can do for you and you’ll hear from a few of our agents about what it’s like to work on our team.</em></p>

Are you interested in a career in real estate? Today I want to discuss the important topic of a career in the real estate field. I’d like you to learn about our team and a couple of our teammates.

**These are some exceptional agents on our team** who have a perspective of what it’s like to be out in the real estate world and then join a real estate team:

**Sarah Hoiland:** "I’ve worked with the Legacy Group for seven years. When I got into real estate, I was very eager. I was delighted to be in a new career and knew this was the career I wanted. I began with a team in Spokane and didn’t get any training or guidance. I was there for about three months but didn’t learn how to fill out a contract and didn’t have any clients. I didn’t know which direction to go with my career.&nbsp;

I heard about the team approach at Keller Williams and interviewed a few times with the Legacy Group and knew that’s where I wanted to be. I spent a couple of weeks in training and received all the information I needed to continue my career. I believe I sold six houses in my first six weeks after being trained. **Now, this is my family away from home.** I have all my best friends here, I have support, experience to learn from, and it’s a great culture.&nbsp;"

**Sally Olsen:** "I’ve been with the Legacy Group for over five years now. I joined the Legacy Group because of all the training and support they provide for us. My first year as a buyer specialist I did $5.2 million in sales. Now, after the first couple of years, I’m a listing specialist.&nbsp;

Our whole team is supportive. I know when I come into the office and have questions or I need help with something, someone’s going to be there that has the expertise to help me out. I have a busy family—I’m a mom of three and this career fits right into my life."

If you’re interested in a potential six-figure income, training, lead generation, coaching, and support in a family dynamic and you want to know more about that, please reach out to me so I can share details of what we do to get more homes sold in the last 12 years than any other real estate team in the area. **We’d love to share that success with you.** I’d be happy to chat with you about it. Also, if you have any further questions, you are always free to reach out to me via phone or email.
