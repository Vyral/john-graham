<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how this year’s market was affected by the pandemic and how it compares to last year’s.</em></p>

On a normal real estate curve, market activity starts the year slowly and begins to pick up in March, April, and May when a huge influx of homes for sale come onto the market. We typically see a lot of activity until school gets out in the middle of June, then the market starts to settle. Then activity picks back up again once school is close to starting as people are trying to get their homes back on the market. After that, activity trails off as the holiday season approaches.

Well this year, we’ve noticed **that curve has been pushed back by two or three months.** The frenzy that usually starts in March didn’t really pick up until June. Right now, school is starting again, and we anticipate in the coming months that there will soon be another influx of not just buyers wanting to purchase now that things have settled, but also sellers who want to put their homes on the market.

So what does that mean for potential sellers? Now that the bell curve has been pushed back by two or three months, it means that sellers still have a great opportunity to get their homes listed and sell them for top dollar. If you’re planning to list around October or November, **get your photos taken now while the grass is still green, the trees are vibrant, and the skies are blue.**
