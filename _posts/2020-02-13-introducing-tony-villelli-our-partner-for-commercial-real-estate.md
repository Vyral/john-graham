I’m here with commercial agent Tony Villelli to explain the brand-new Legacy Commercial Group Network.

We’re hardly into 2020, and we already have some major news to break: **The Legacy Group has officially teamed up with Licensed Commercial Agent Tony Villelli** and his team to form The Legacy Commercial Group Network.&nbsp;

For those out there in the market with commercial interests, we now have one of the top commercial agents in the entire industry on board\!&nbsp;

Tony and his team of commercial agents have been working alongside The Legacy Group for quite some time now, and this step forward in our partnership provides our combined client bases with incredible additional resources.&nbsp;

Tying together residential and commercial expertise means that **we’re no longer limited in how we can help our clients achieve their real estate goals**.&nbsp;

As Tony says, everyone has a connection to commercial real estate, whether you’re a real estate investor, or a business owner looking for space to expand. If you’re neither of those, then the building in which you work is likely commercial real estate. One way or another, it’s a part of all of our lives.&nbsp;

For us, this move just makes sense; we’re always focused on growth that enables us to do more for our clients. Many times I’ve seen Tony work with someone who had previously never considered the opportunities that exist in the commercial sector, and, after listening to their needs, showed them that this side of the real estate market may be the best fit for their investment.&nbsp;

Right now, Tony and I are working with a retired veteran who has just returned from overseas and is determined to start his own business. In fact, he’s more concerned about getting the commercial real estate component of his business squared away than he is about purchasing a new home for himself—if his entrepreneurial endeavor thrives, he may be able to buy a large one\!&nbsp;

This case is just one example of many to come where **Tony and his team act as a perfect complement to The Legacy Group.** We’re thrilled to be working with him, and look forward to the future together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have questions or are unsure if commercial real estate is right for you, we can schedule a consultation. Feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We’re always glad to hear from you.
