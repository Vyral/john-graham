<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m here with commercial agent Tony Villelli to explain the brand-new Legacy Commercial Group Network.</em></p>

We have some monumental news to break: **The Legacy Group has officially teamed up with Licensed Commercial Agent Tony Villelli** and his team to form The Legacy Commercial Group Network\!&nbsp;

For those out there in the market with commercial interests, **we now have one of the top commercial agents in the entire industry on board**, and we’re ready to bring our unparalleled service to more clients than ever before.&nbsp;

Tony and his team of commercial agents have been working alongside The Legacy Group for quite some time now, and this huge leap forward provides our combined client bases with incredible additional resources\!&nbsp;

Tying together residential and commercial expertise means **there’s no limit to how we can help our clients achieve their real estate goals**.&nbsp;

Everyone has a connection to commercial real estate, whether as an investor, a business owner looking for space to expand, or someone who works in a commercial-zoned building daily. Tony is phenomenal at listening to the clients’ needs. Thanks to his expert advice, countless clients who would have otherwise never considered commercial real estate are reaping major benefits.

Right now, Tony and I are working with a retired veteran who just returned from overseas and is determined to start his own business. In fact, he’s more concerned about getting the commercial real estate component of his business squared away than he is about purchasing a new home for himself—if his entrepreneurial endeavor thrives, he may be able to buy a large one\!&nbsp;

This case is just one example of many to come where **Tony and his team act as a perfect complement to The Legacy Group.** We’re thrilled to be working with him, and look forward to the limitless future together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have questions or are unsure if commercial real estate is right for you, we can schedule a consultation. Feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We’re always glad to hear from you.
