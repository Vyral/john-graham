Now is a great time to grow your net worth. Here’s why.</em></p>

I just had a conversation with one of our agents who has a young client that just bought their first home and then discovered that a trio of triplexes would be built right next door.&nbsp;

Upon realizing that they’d soon have nine renters for neighbors, they decided they wanted to sell their newly owned property. Their agent initially agreed with them, but then I sat down and talked with them about their client’s long-term objective, which was to grow his net worth.

That’s when I explained that now was a perfect opportunity to do that. **Homes are appreciating at an all-time high and interest rates are down to 3%,** which is practically free money. If property values are going up and money is cheap to borrow, why pay money to get out of a house? Why not just have his client turn that house into a rental and make that his first investment property. If he needs more money to buy a new house, he can use the income from that investment property. It makes more sense to buy a new house,&nbsp; which would become an asset and help him grow his net worth.&nbsp;

During this conversation, I admitted that I wish I would’ve known this strategy when I was 22 years old. About 90% of my net worth is through real estate, and that took a long time for me to even consider building my net worth this way.&nbsp;

No matter what age you are or how many properties you own, **now’s a great time to add more real estate to your portfolio and grow your net worth.&nbsp;**

If you’d like to know more about growing your net worth or have any real estate questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;
