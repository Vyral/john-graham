<center>Shannon Braggs is here to explain why buyers benefit from representation.</center>

&nbsp;

It’s natural for a lot of homebuyers to ask themselves, “Why do I need representation?” After all, in the digital age, home searches have never been easier; can’t you just do everything yourself? As Shannon Braggs, one of our senior agents at the Legacy Group Network, explains it: “You always want to have somebody looking out for your best interests from the beginning to the end of the transaction.”&nbsp;

This advice applies to new construction homes, too; Shannon is currently representing three clients on new construction properties. Resale and new construction are alike in that **it’s neither the listing agent’s nor the builder’s duty to represent the buyer’s interests.&nbsp;**

Think about this: The smiling face on that sign in the seller’s yard belongs to someone with only one objective: Maximize the seller’s position and net the most money for their seller. That listing agent has a fiduciary responsibility to represent the seller. Also, far from being a neutral party, builders only care about representing the building company’s interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer going it alone and you call up the listing agent for a house you’re interested in, you’re essentially starting a potential transaction with *zero* representation of your own. Any business dealings that develop from there will be inherently inequitable. Shannon knows all too well how true that is; she started her career in real estate after her own experience of being a disadvantaged buyer, and now she has a passion and deep respect for the buyer’s agent role.&nbsp;

**When it comes to looking at homes, negotiating terms in a contract, or simply making sense of market conditions, buyers need an expert in their corner.** Imagine if, for whatever reason, you found yourself in a court of law going up against a prosecuting attorney—an experienced professional—who will be trying their best to put you in jail. Why would you ever trust that same prosecutor to represent your defense argument, too?

Likewise, if the listing agent has a fiduciary responsibility to the seller, why on earth would you let that agent oversee your interests as a buyer? Shannon said that oftentimes during the buyer consultation, she’ll see the light bulbs go on in buyers’ minds: “Oh, wow, I’ve never thought of it that way,” they say.&nbsp;

Here’s the kicker: **To have someone like Shannon, one of the most experienced and top-performing agents in the area, represent you as a buyer***\*\*costs you absolutely nothing. \*\**That’s because the seller is the one paying the commission to sell their home. So many buyers don’t know that having a pro in their corner adds incredible value for no cost.&nbsp;

Hopefully, if you’re a potential buyer, this message cleared up a lot of confusion and left you feeling empowered—after all, giving buyers a sense of control is what agents like Shannon are passionate about. As always, reach out via phone or email if you have any questions about this or other real estate topics. We’d love to hear from you\!&nbsp;
