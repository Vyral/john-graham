<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tony Villelli is the head of our new commercial real estate team, and I’m excited about what this partnership means for our clients.</em></p>

Today I’m joined by Tony Villelli, the head of our new commercial real estate team, to talk a little about his backstory and how he can help with your commercial real estate needs.&nbsp;

Tony’s been working in commercial real estate his entire life. He got his license 25 years ago after graduating from Gonzaga University, and as he says, commercial real estate is in his blood. He’s a third-generation agent who was named after his grandfather, who got his start in the real estate business after returning home from World War II.&nbsp;

From the first day I met Tony, I could tell he was passionate about the business, and that’s part of the reason why I think we’ll have such a successful partnership. His team covers both the Washington and Idaho markets.

A lot of people assume investing in commercial real estate isn’t possible for them until they learn about all the options they have, be it a tiny commercial condo you can buy for under $200,000 to commercial land that’s in the process of growing. **If you’ve been saving money for such a purchase, Tony and his team can help you with all aspects of the process,** from bare dirt, to developing that dirt, to putting a tenant in the property.&nbsp;

Aside from investors, they can also help people who are looking to take the next step for their business. If you’ve been working out of your garage and your business is growing, for example, they can help you lease a bigger facility.&nbsp;

Tony can help someone with a commercial property that has some deferred maintenance, fix it up, and sell it for far more money than it was originally worth. He once helped a couple flip a commercial storage unit for over $200,000 more than they originally could have sold it for.&nbsp;

*That’s* value. *That’s* an investment. **With Tony on board, that’s also something the Legacy Group can do for you, whether you live in Idaho or Washington.** If you’d like to get in touch with Tony, you can reach him by phone at (208) 661-3044 or email him at [tony@villellipnw.com](mailto:tony@villellipnw.com).&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other real estate questions or are thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give anyone else on our team a call. We’d love to help you.
