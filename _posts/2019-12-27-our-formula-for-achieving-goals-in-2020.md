Here our the three steps we use to achieve success that anyone can implement.

Right now, people are assessing their situations and making a plan to improve in the new year. One notoriously flaky goal is fitness; people start off excited to get in shape, but once February, March, April, and May roll through, that goal has fallen by the wayside.&nbsp;

Other popular goals may be career-related. Perhaps you’re looking to switch to a profession that provides both a substantial income and healthy work-life balance. Here at the Legacy Group, we’ve developed a sort of ‘secret sauce’ when it comes to offering well-balanced opportunities.&nbsp;

People who want to get in shape but fail to do so have good intentions but usually no solid plan. Having a step-by-step plan is the first key to reaching your goals. If you want to succeed in the real estate profession, you’ll need a plan. **At Legacy, we actually craft a high-level business plan for our new team members.&nbsp;**

The second key is creating a schedule to keep yourself on track. We believe in EDDs, or ‘everyday drills’—the things you come in and do every day that will yield results for you in the future.&nbsp;

The third key is accountability. A plan and schedule aren’t enough; **you must find ways to hold yourself accountable and complete the tasks you have set up for yourself.** We coach our agents daily on how to handle complex business conversations, and we help hold them accountable for implementing what they learn.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in making a change in 2020, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. I’d love to share exactly how Legacy Group has generated the best results in the Spokane and Coeur d’Alene for the past decade.
