<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now that we’ve partnered with PRMG, we can take care of all of your home buying needs.</em></p>

As you know, we’re working on growing The Legacy Group and being your one-stop shop for all things real estate.&nbsp;

When buying a home, it’s not unusual to have to go one place to secure a mortgage, another place to sell your current home, another place to buy your next home, another place to help you store your belongings, etc.

The next step in our evolution is to have our own in-house mortgage company. Instead of asking you to go somewhere else to secure a good mortgage, **we’ve taken this step for you by partnering with one of the best mortgage companies in the country: Paramount Residential Mortgage Group.** Joining us today to tell you what PRMG can offer is Nick Garcia.

PRMG is licensed in 48 states, and they have an industry-leading array of loan programs— including options for those who don’t fit the typical home buying mold. Also, it’s important to note that they only focus on mortgages. They’d never ask anyone, for example, to open a bank account with them; their team is highly specialized. There are a lot of potential bumps along the road to buying a home, but their structure allows them to make decisions that keep the transaction moving smoothly.&nbsp;

When a person is thinking about buying a home, they have a lot to do. They have to find a real estate agent, find a lender (and vet the lending process of that company), find a home to buy, *and* go through all the steps of buying that home. One of the advantages of having an in-house mortgage company is that we can take care of everything for you.&nbsp;

Another advantage of using an in-house lender instead of finding one on your own is that it allows for seamless communication. The fact is, a ton of communication takes place between a lender and a Realtor during a home purchase. These are the people who push everything forward, and having a cohesive team behind you simplifies everything and ensures everyone is on the same page.&nbsp;

We always ask our clients: What are the three things you’re looking for in a real estate company so that we know you can have the best possible experience with The Legacy Group? Nine out of 10 people say their top priority is communication. **With PRMG on our side, we’re all on the same page.&nbsp;**

Simple, quick, and easy—that’s what we’re all about. We’re excited to have Nick and everyone else at PMRG aboard with us, and we look forward to helping you with your mortgage and other real estate needs.
