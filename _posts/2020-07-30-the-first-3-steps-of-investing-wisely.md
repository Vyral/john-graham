These are the first three steps to know if you want to begin investing.

I’ve been speaking to a few people lately about how to get started with investing, so today I’m sharing the first three steps involved for anyone else who might be curious:&nbsp;

**1\. Find someone experienced.** Whether it’s a real estate agent you trust or a family member, find someone who’s experienced in the business to assist you. They don’t necessarily have to be experienced in investing, but that would help.&nbsp;

**2 .Figure out how you’re going to pay for the property.** This often means finding someone who will lend you the money, but cash is the best way to go if you have it. People usually meet with a mortgage lender to help them finance their investment. You could also meet with a private lender; they’re usually more flexible with their lending criteria. The third option is to ask a family member, which isn’t uncommon for first-time investors to do.

**3\. Get educated.** Get on the internet, do the research, and find some books on investing (there are many great ones out there). You’re looking for information about what’s going to be a great investment property. Where are these properties typically located? What type of return on investment can you expect from a good investment property? Learn all you need to know before jumping into the investing pool.&nbsp;
