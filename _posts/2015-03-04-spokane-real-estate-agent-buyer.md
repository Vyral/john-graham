Spring is nearly here and we are very excited for all the activity that the season will bring. There are some very exciting things going on in Spokane, for both buyers and sellers, and we want you to know about them. People have been asking us where the best places to live in Spokane are, so today we are going to talk about a few of our favorites.

The first is Kendall Yards, located downtown, right on the Spokane River. It's beautiful down there, and the area is within walking distance of downtown. They've got condos, single-family homes, restaurants, shopping, and more.

The second place we love in Spokane is Coyote Rock at River Crest. It's down on the Spokane River in the valley, and it's a beautiful neighborhood. Located right on the Centennial Trail, you can walk right out your front door onto the trail, or onto the river. We think this is the next big thing in Spokane real estate, and we think you'll agree once you see the properties there.

If you'd like to check out some of these hotspots and see what they are all about, we are here to help, just give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to set up a time with you to show you just how great these areas are.
